							<p><strong>Hello and welcome</strong> to my page. My name is Jordan Edwards,
							I'm a 23 year old fitness enthusiast. I work professionally as a software engineer
							and as a personal trainer on the side. If you have reached this page I assume you 
							are interested in learning more about my training, which you can find more information
							about below. If not, you and I are equally confused about how you got here; might I
							suggest going to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> or 
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> instead, they have much more entertaining
							content than my site does.</p>

							<h2>About my services</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>My training is ideal for those looking to <strong>build muscle, lose fat, or improve functional
							strength.</strong> Your current level of fitness is not important to me, however I do look for
							clients who are committed, willing to work hard, and understand that results take time and will
							not be evident from just a few sessions.</p>
							<p>I offer <strong>in person, one-on-one or small group (2-3) training sessions.</strong> 
							I also provide guidance on nutrition and general healthy life habits.</p>
							<p>If you are looking for guidance on a more specific or goal, such as improved performance
							in baseball, or recovering from an ACL tear, it is probably better to search for someone who 
							specializes in that area.
							</p>
							I do not provide any medical advice or provide information on any
							drug usage, performance-enhancing or otherwise.

							<h2>Why choose me?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Have you ever been in a gym and noticed a personal trainer who is unenthusiastically
							guiding their client through different exercises, and doesn't even look to be in very 
							good shape themselves? I certainly have, and it surprises me how common this is.</p>
							<p>At bootcamps the trainers are often better; they participate in the workout themselves
							and are in great shape as a result. But these classes can be very large, a single trainer 
							might be responsible for 20+ people at once. For those looking for more specific
							guidance and attention this isn't always a good option.</p>
							<p>Because I only train individual clients or small groups, I am able to actively engage with 
							my clients throughout the entire workout. I also believe in leading by example, meaning I
							participate in workouts with my clients..</p>
							<p>To me, fitness is a passion first, and a job second, which I believe differentiates me from
							many trainers out there.</p>

							<h2>Pricing and options</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Initial consultation (~45 minutes)</strong> - $25<br/>
							This is a one-time meeting to assess your goals and develop an understanding
							of what you are looking to get out of our training sessions. It is also a chance
							to ask me any outstanding questions. I use the information from this to develop
							a training and diet plan that is specific to your personal goals, schedule, etc.</p>
							<p><strong>Individual training session (75 minutes)</strong> - $35<br/>
							This is a typical training session that involves a 5-10 minute warmup, 
							approximately 60 minutes of resistance training, and a few minutes of stretching and 
							cooldown at the end. The total session should take about 75 minutes, however
							it will vary slightly depending on the workout and the busyness of the gym.</p>
							<p><strong>Small group training session (90 minutes)</strong> - $25/person<br/>
							This is an option if you would prefer to train with up to two other family
							members or friends. Additional time is allocated compared to the individual session 
							to account for the potentially slower pace of training in group.</p>
							<p><strong>Other</strong> - $???<br/>
							If you are interested in a different offering than what is listed above please get
							in touch with me and we can discuss it.</p>
							<p><strong>Refund Policy</strong><br/>
							If, after an initial consultation and/or training session, you decide that you do not want
							to continue I will refund half of the total cost. If we have done multiple sessions together 
							the most recent session will be refunded in full.</p>

							<h2>My fitness journey</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>My fitness journey began at the age of 18 during my first year of university.
								Over Christmas break I had been dumped by my highschool girlfriend, and as many
								18 year old men would, I decided it happened because my arms were not big enough.
								Thus began my obsession with working out. Over time my goals have shifted away from 
								vanity and become more focused on a balance of strength and overall well-being. 
								I've made a lot of mistakes and gained a lot of knowledge in my 5+ years of consistently 
								working out, and would love to share these learnings with as many people as possible.

							<h2>FAQ</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Where do you train?</strong><br/>
							I am <strong>based out of Toronto, Ontario</strong>, and currently have memberships to GoodLife (all
							locations) and Fortis Fitness West (east end of Mississauga). If you would prefer to
							train at another location near downtown Toronto I can accomodate that, however you will
							need to cover any additional costs.</p>
							<p><strong>Why are your rates much lower than other personal trainers?</strong><br/>
							Personal training is not my primary source of income, it is something I do because 
							I enjoy sharing my knowledge and helping others. For this reason I don't care to charge 
							a lot as I want my training to be affordable to many people, and I would rather work with 
							clients who are extremely committed, rather than those willing to pay a lot. Also, because 
							I don't work for a gym or studio, there is no extra margin on top of my fees.</p>
							<p><strong>If you don't need the money, why charge at all?</strong><br/>
							There are two reasons. Firstly, although it is a hobby, personal training still takes
							up a considerable amount of time. I put a lot of planning into the routines for my clients 
							before showing up at the gym. Secondly, I believe that charging a fee helps to keep both 
							sides more committed: the client because they have financial investment into it,
							and myself because I want to make sure that every clients gets their money's worth.</p>
							<p><strong>When are you available?</strong><br/>
							Because I work a full-time job through the week my in-person availability is limited,
							I prefer to train clients on weekends although early mornings before work and evenings
							are also an option.</p>
							<p><strong>Do you even lift?</strong><br/>
							¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
