        <h2>Adding yoga to resistance training: an unexpected benefit</h2>
      </section>

        <p>
          Back in October of 2019 I began suffering from some minor knee pain, which was
          unusual because it was only in a single knee, and even more so because I had been
          following the same routine for several months with no issues. At first I tried to ignore
          it, figuring it was a temporary problem and that it would work itself out. But as the weeks
          went on it grew from a small discomfort to an intense "pulling" sensation that
          had me worried that a muscle might tear if I kept on going. I took a few days off
          from the gym and did some light stretching of the muscles that I suspected might be
          contributing factors. When I returned to the gym, as I'd hoped my knee felt back to normal,
          and I could workout again pain-free. But not for long. Surely enough about a week later the
          pain was back and again I was afraid to workout with full intensity at the risk of injury.
          <br/>
          So what was there to do about it?
          <br/>
          For me, the answer was yoga. I started 

          But the benefits didn't stop there, which leads me to the point of this post.
